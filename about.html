  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">I am a web developer and software engineer based in Kansas City, Missouri. My expertise and interest lies in frontend development with frameworks like React and Ruby on Rails. I also enjoy dabbling in general UI/UX design with a particular goal of understanding the human side of software development. In the words of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a>, "Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them... you have to study the people <i>behind</i> the software, too."</p>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">When I'm not buried in code, I enjoy playing video games and going on food adventures! I believe the best way to learn about a person and their culture is through their food. I spend much of my weekends trying new restaurants and learning how to cook different foods with friends. You can follow my adventures here on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heysharynne" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!</p>
