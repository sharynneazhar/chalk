Hey peeps. This is the start of my coding related blog! I’ve been wanting to start this but never really found a good opportunity.

Until now! 🤗

As part of my internship training, I was tasked to come up with a project idea and build it from scratch! Front-end to back-end. Ruby on Rails. I had a few different ideas but this one is the most relevant to my current hobbies. So, without further ado, I introduce you…

TopSetup™ - Browse top setups from around the world or show off your own setup!

This idea came from a little winter break project to convert the office room into a gaming room. There weren’t very many dedicated websites out there for full gaming and work setups. Of course there are sites like [PCPartPicker.com][1] and a bunch of different subreddits, but I wanted something more whole and cough pretty.

So, here’s to starting a this blog 🍻 and here’s to documenting my coding journey 🍻. Check out the images below to witness the early designs of TopSetup™!
