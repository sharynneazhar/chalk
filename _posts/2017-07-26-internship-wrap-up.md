Oh my goodness. It is officially my last week as a Cerner intern. \**sad face*\*

When I began the internship, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect, especially since half of my friends work for Cerner. The internship is going to start off slow with orientation and a few tours. Then, I'll be thrown right into a project and I'll learn how to be big girl developer. Pretty chill.

It has been a little over two months now and I have learned so much about software engineering, the important role Cerner plays in healthcare IT, and what it takes to excel in this industry. I am glad to say that my internship with Cerner has been more meaningful than my expectations. Here are a few of my favorite takeaways and moments:

**Favorite Takeaways**:

* **The people around you are there in your best interest.** Even though I already had friends at Cerner, starting a job at a new place can prove to be difficult, especially if you're extremely timid like me. You're a new face and there is already an established culture. I felt pressured to fit in, but to my surprise, it wasn't like that at all. From day one, *I didn't expect* to feel so welcomed. As people walked by my desk, they made it a point to stop by and say hi or to ask if I needed any help. Some even invited me to grab lunch or coffee.

* **Keep an open mind and soak it all in.** Going into my internship, *I didn't expect* to be working directly under a Distinguished Architect, a.k.a. Really Important Person. Not only that, I was given the opportunity to work on a brand new project. So, almost all the code will be written by me. Talk about a valuable experience! Intimidating too. Nonetheless, my manager had been supportive throughout and patient with my noobiness. Besides programming experience, being with a person of high caliber like my manager has given me an inside look of what it is like to manage not only a small team but an entire organization. This was incredibly special to me.

* **Be the rockstar that you are.** It's perfectly OK to be shameless. I am naturally hard on myself and rarely feel like I'm qualified. *I didn't expect* to be given so much responsibility and trust on the project. It made me feel like I'm another member of the team and not just an intern. My manager trusted me, so I should trust myself and in my abilities. Your mentors want you to succeed so don't be afraid to show what you got. Don't be afraid to make mistakes either!

* **Have some fun.** Work hard, play hard. Fun is just as important when it comes to culture. Cerner holds a stigma of being a "sweatshop" due to a controversial email in the past. However, *I didn't expect* how much I'd enjoy this internship. I understand why culture is such an important thing now, and why companies like Cerner and Google spend so much on developing a creative office space.

**Favorite Memories**:

* Winning third place at the [Cerner Intern Hackfest][2] and having the opportunity to present in front of 50+ interns and other Cerner employees in the [Assembly][3]. It was one heck of a week with lots and lots of code and data mining. It was also one heck of a struggle balancing actual work with Hackfest work. Here are a couple pictures from the event:

* Learning [how to effectively use an office space to prank your team members][1] at DevCon. It was so amazing to see Cerner supporting good ol' office pranks. It really showed me that Cerner cares about having a positive company culture.

* Drinking an absurd amount of coffee. There are free coffee machines on every floor of the Cerner campus and it doesn't seem to ever run out of coffee. It's a dream come true.

* Flynn's Arcade. Spending hours on end playing Galaga or Foosball. Some friends also came to visit one day and we spent a good hour finishing a round of Chinese Checkers. Also, shouts to the giant chess set on the 5th floor.

* Cerner Interns 17 Discord. It's a love-hate relationship.

These past two months have been an awesome experience. Cerner is a giant in the healthcare IT space and has a pretty cool company culture ❄️. My best takeaway? Throw away all expectations. Just be open, trust yourself, and have some fun. You'll be surprised of the rewards. I am beyond thankful and will definitely miss being around the office, but I'm excited to see what the future holds.

Who knows, maybe I'll be back next year. Full-time. 😉
